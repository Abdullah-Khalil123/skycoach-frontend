  The Best Way to Gear Up in The War Within
Running Mythic+ Dungeons and slaying Raid Bosses is the best way to gear up in WoW The War Within. These activities offer a ton of higher-level content to earn gear from. You can start from the very basics, like Normal Dungeons or LFR Raids, and progress to the very top of this system. At the peak point, you will complete M+10 Keystones and Mythic Raids to earn the best loot possible.

We will describe these two methods in more detail further in our guide. You will also learn about other gear sources you can use in The War Within. Combining as many of them as possible will help you earn the rarest and strongest equipment pieces for your WoW character.

Campaign Completion
The gear progression system in WoW is refined from top to bottom. The developers have thought through every step of how you can obtain gear in the game. During the early game, your best way to get gear in The War Within is to complete the Campaign. This will help you prepare for Mythic+ Dungeons and Raids in the future.

Starting with the Campaign is the first step you should take when entering the latest TWW expansion. You will be tasked with finishing a range of quests. In return, you can get various rewards, including new gear. Don't want to bother with this? You can Get Ghosts of K'aresh Campaign Completion at Skycoach in just a few clicks. Our PROs will help you with all the questlines and obtain well-deserved rewards for you.

Auction House
Auction House is a less obvious choice for WoW gearing when only starting out. However, getting 639 ilvl gear from the Auction House is always a good idea. This item level is more than enough to jump into Heroic dungeons and start farming for something better. Just make sure you have enough Gold to buy whatever you need. Also, be prepared for the overwhelming price increase right after The War Within Season 3 starts. Most players will try to sell things at an exorbitant cost during the first days.

You can also use Auction House to fill some equipment slots. This will be useful if you cannot get the desired items from the latest Raids or M+ Keys. At Skycoach, you can Get WoW Gold delivered to any server at the most reasonable price. With our help, you can rest assured knowing you always have enough currency to purchase everything you want in the game!

Dungeon Gear
Running dungeons is by far the best way to gear up in The War Within. This type of activity offers a ladder-like progression system, allowing you to climb from the worst to the best gear possible. With the start of Season 3, you can dive into the following dungeon types in WoW:

Normal
Heroic
Mythic
Mythic+
Focusing on running M+ Dungeons is the key to getting gear in The War Within Season 3. You can easily finish Mythic 0 wearing equipment of 660-665 ilvl or so. From that point, you can progress to M +2 and further acquire better gear along the way. To move from one tier to another faster, we highly recommend using classes from our M+ DPS rankings to see who is stronger in the current meta.

You can participate in dungeons through either Dungeon Finder or start a run with your friends. Here is what ilvl gear you can get from basic-difficulty dungeons in TWW Season 3:

Heroic — Item Level 665
Mythic — Item Level 681
With the last M+ system update, you can now get the best gear possible upon completing +10 Keystones. Here is a table containing details on gear ilvl you get from dungeons in WoW The War Within Season 3:

Difficulty	Season 3	Great Vault
Heroic	665	678
Mythic	681	691
+2	684	694
+3	684	694
+4	688	697
+5	691	697
+6	694	701
+7	694	704
+8	697	704
+9	697	704
+10	701	707
+11	701	707
+12	701	707
Finishing higher levels only makes sense if you are after specific achievements or wish to boast about your title to friends. Our PROs can help you get the best seasonal reward, including the KSM Mount in a jiffy. Trust the boring grind and farm to us while you are exploring the latest WoW expansion.`,
